# sfnt2woff

The original author of these tools is Jonathan Kew from Mozilla. I needed to simplify and adjust some tools for backend use.

The main binary now accepts a customized path as destination. Also a tool for directly outputting font metadata is provided under an obvious name: woffmetadata.

It would be nice to bind some functions to ruby (woff.c) and have it ready as a gem.
